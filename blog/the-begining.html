			<h1>The Beginning</h1>
				<p>In 2012 when I first found out about what a developer bootcamp was I begged my wife to let me quit my job, move to California, sleep on my friends floor in San Ramon, and commute to San Francisco to attend <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>. Then we laughed and laughed because the reality is I have a full time job, a wife, and lots of statements that come in the mail with my name on it requesting payments.</p>

<p>2013 comes around and I found out about an online fullstack web development course offered by <a href="https://www.bloc.io/">Bloc</a>. Soon after they offered a flexible schedule whereas I can keep my job and study at night. I figured this was my chance so I decided to begin prepping by purchasing a <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> account to get familiar with everything I would encounter so I can really focus on the content rather than the basics. 2014 started out great with Treehouse classes after work as I glided through the HTML and CSS sections feeling really good about everything I was learning.</p>

<p>Fast forward until about two weeks ago as I just finished working with a developer in Ireland to finish up a huge 500 page company website that included five different themes for all of the conferences that are created within the site. Everything begins going wrong at the same time. Outside designers? Slacking. New host? Crashing. Company domains? Expiring. Keyboards? Unplugged. Left foot? Asleep. I'm burned out and my Treehouse account had not been visited in months since taking on this project. You know how it goes.</p>

<p>I began to get into long conversations with my wife about how frustrated I was and how I really wanted to learn to program but these one night on few nights off were not getting me that far because of how busy at work I was. Then the moment happened. What if we bit the bullet and I stopped attending work and attended a coding bootcamp? The more we spoke about it and pretend plan it out the more it made sense at this point in our lives. Plenty of coding bootcamps were available in New York City and I didn't have to move because of how close we live. Plus the job market for developers in New York looks pretty good right now. "Let's do it," she said.</p>

<p>I immediately went into crazy bootcamp search mode. I scoured the web for all of the coding bootcamp reviews I could find and read every single one. One of the blogs I read mentioned physically visiting these bootcamps, looking around, and asking every question you could possibly think of. I thought that was a great idea so last Tuesday I visited Dev Bootcamp downtown and I have to say I was quite impressed. They answered every question I had and even grabbed a coding coach and the head of career development to make sure I was getting answers from the right people. I left feeling like I could really fit in and is currently a strong contender.</p>

<p>The other coding bootcamp that really caught my eye was <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy</a>. Every review I read about them is amazing. Seriously, take moment to just read through some of these reviews on Quora. After a few back and forth emails with Huntly their Director of Admissions I decided to get my feet wet and signed up for their Jumpstart program which starts on October 14th and goes until October 23rd. This program promises to prep you for the admissions process to get into Fullstack Academy.</p>

<p>In my next post I'll follow up after my first day of Fullstack Academy's Jumpstart program and let you know how its going. Until then thanks for reading the beginning of my journey!</p>
