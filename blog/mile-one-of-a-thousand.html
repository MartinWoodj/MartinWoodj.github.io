			<h1>Mile One of a Thousand</h1>
<p>Okay so I lied. I was supposed to write about my experience at <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy's</a> two week <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/jumpstart">Programming for Non-Programmers</a> class after each class. Honestly so much happened so fast I almost didn’t have time to keep up. I'll outline my overall experience here though so don’t worry.</p>

<p>First day in class didn't go so well. <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack</a> forgot to send me the pre-work that everyone was supposed to do so in the latter part of the class I was pretty much completely lost and stared at my screen for long periods of time trying to figure out the questions. I was assured that it was no problem and that I can just catch up for the following class which I did. So although the first class wasn’t a great first experience the next three classes were amazing and completely made up for the loss.</p>

<p>The class homework was a mix of the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Codecademy JavaScript</a> track from the intro through to while loops, questions posted on their internal learning website, and some <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> questions. I got the most out of <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and the posted questions but struggled with <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>. If you are thinking about taking the class I would recommend spending a good amount of time going through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Codecademy's JavaScript</a> course a few times so you can hit the ground running when you get to class.</p>

<p>The in class portion consisted of our instructor <a href="https://twitter.com/scottdaless">Scott D&#39;Alessandro</a> going over the problems from last class and then a short presentation on some new JavaScript terms to learn for next class. After the presentation we would work on problems and Scott would call in a few other students from the full time course in to help anyone that had questions. The first quick observation I had was that these people knew their shit! I like that and it speaks to the type of education these people are getting. Second is that they are truly patient with everyone and will even stay late to make sure you are understanding everything you are learning.</p>

<p>Overall I would say even though the first class was a little rough I learned so much in the subsequent classes that it almost didn't matter. If I had to provide any recommendations to <a href="http://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy</a> about this course it would be to perhaps turn this into something like a two or three month prep course that at the end will fully equip you to apply their full blown bootcamp with confidence.</p>
