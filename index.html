		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Hi there, I'm Joe. I 'm a really nice guy that maintains a healthy balance between video games, learning to program and time with my wife. Currently I'm learning to be a font-end developer from <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> with mostly HTML, CSS, and email design experience I picked up along the way.</p>

		<h1>Where I'm from</h1>
		<p>I was born in Long Island, New York and moved upstate New York to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains" target="_blank">Catskill Mountains</a> where I spent most of my young life. In my early 20's I moved to southwest Florida where I went to college and met my beautiful wife. I have recently moved back to the northeast and currently reside in New Jersey.</p>
